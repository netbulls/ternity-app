# Leave Management

## Overview

Timetastic-style leave management integrated with the time tracking hierarchy. Employees request time off, managers approve per-project, and approved leave appears on a shared calendar.

## Core Workflows

### Leave Requests

1. Employee submits a day-off request (date range, leave type)
2. Request is routed to the designated approver for that project
3. Approver receives notification, approves or rejects
4. Approved leave appears on the shared calendar
5. Leave allowances are tracked (remaining days per type)

### Calendar View

1. Shared calendar shows who's out (approved leave)
2. Can overlay personal time entries for visual overview
